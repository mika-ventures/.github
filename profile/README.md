Welcome to **Mika Ventures** – where engineering excellence meets entrepreneurial spirit.

We're Miguel and Karen, a husband-and-wife team of engineers and business owners building across multiple ventures.

## 🧭 Start Here

All development in this organization runs through **[claude-workspace](https://github.com/mika-ventures/claude-workspace)** — the central hub with coding standards, project index, and Claude AI collaboration guidelines.

If you're starting a session, clone that repo first and read its `CLAUDE.md`.
